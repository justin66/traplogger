<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://www.dnai.com/~justins/trapmon/trapmond">This perl script</a>
      is meant to be used with the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/man/snmptrapd.html">

       utility found within the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">
  NET-SNMP</a>
      software package to  log network activity reported by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://www.linksys.com/products/group.asp?grid=5">
     Linksys DSL router</a>
      via SNMP. This script should run on any platform on which NET-SNMP
runs, although I have not tested with Windows yet. The script and the snmptrapd 
daemon that it invokes both have very modest memory and CPU requirements. 
<br>
<br>
 Linksys DSL routers send their logging information via SNMP traps  to one 
host on your  LAN or broadcast to all the hosts depending on how you  have 
the router  configured. The script I'm providing invokes snmptrapd,  parses 
its'  output as connections arrive, and writes incoming and outgoing  connection 
data to a log file in a directory of your choosing.     
<h4>Requirements<br>
</h4>
     You can run this script on any system that has a modern version of Perl
  and a recent version of NET-SNMP. If you are running a commercial distribution 
  of Linux it is quite likely these are included. Advice on how to build NET-SNMP
  on unsupported platforms for which binaries are not available is beyond
the  scope of this document. However I can offer one piece of advice: if
trapmon  is the only reason you're compiling NET-SNMP, try a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#What_happens_if_mine_isn_t_listed_">
     "minimal agent" build.</a>
<br>
<p>The script needs to be run as 'root' since snmptrapd needs to bind to a
trusted tcp port. The following steps are required in order to make this script
work:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>configure the router to send SNMP traps with logging information</li>
  <li>verify that NET-SNMP is installed</li>
  <li>copy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://www.dnai.com/~justins/trapmon/trapmond">the script</a>
      to a standard location on your system and make sure it's owned by root. 
  I put it in /usr/local/bin but /usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin might be more 
  appropriate. (I put it in /usr/freeware/bin on my IRIX system)</li>
  <li>make a directory to hold the logs, preferably owned by root. I use /var/log/trapmond<br>
  </li>
  <li>figure out how you will start the script. You might end up using the 
  "trapmon" shell script, described further below.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Setup<br>
</h4>
<p>   In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://www.dnai.com/~justins/trapmon/snapshot13.jpg">
      this screenshot</a>
      you can see how I  have configured my router to broadcast the logging 
 info  to all the hosts  on the LAN by specifying a "255" address and selecting 
 "enable." If you are only logging on one   host on the LAN and you're using 
 static IP addresses you can specify that host's individual address.   </p>
     Try "which snmptrapd" as root to verify NET-SNMP is installed. If you
 see  no results try find / &nbsp;| grep snmptrapd . Still nothing? You probably 
  need to install NET-SNMP.<br>
<br>
     To startup the script from the command line, as root type "trapmond
/var/log/trapmond"   (or whatever you want your logs to be written). If you
want to view  the raw snmptrapd output on your screen while the script operates,
specify  the&nbsp; debug option on the command line, signified by a '1':
"trapmond /var/log/trapmond 1"<br>
<br>
     Usually you'll want to run the script as a daemon at boot time. I'm
providing   a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://www.dnai.com/~justins/trapmon/trapmon">shell
script</a>
      to help with that. On a reasonably standard system with SysV init these 
  steps should get this starting at boot time:<br>
<ul>
  <li>as mentioned above, make sure trapmond (the perl script) is installed 
  in /usr/local/bin or somewhere similar and create your log file directory</li>
  <li>copy trapmon (the shell script) to /etc/init.d and create these symbolic 
  links:</li>
  <li>cd /etc/init.d/rc3.d</li>
  <li>ln -s /etc/init.d/trapmon K01trapmon</li>
  <li>ln -s /etc/init.d/trapmon S99trapmon</li>
  <li>cd /etc/init.d/rc5.d&nbsp;</li>
  <li>ln -s /etc/init.d/trapmon K01trapmon</li>
  <li>ln -s /etc/init.d/trapmon S99trapmon</li>
  <li>view /etc/init.d/trapmon with a text editor and make sure the settings 
  for LOGDIR and PATH are adequate. The LOGDIR value should match the log 
file  directory you created and you can add entries to the PATH if something 
isn't  being started properly (if snmptrapd or trapmond aren't in root's boot
path<br>
  </li>
</ul>
      Boom. It should startup properly next time you boot and you can do
a  "ps -A | grep trap" to see the running processes. Browse the directory
where logs are written to see incoming and outgoing connection activity.<br>
<h4>Output<br>
</h4>
     The log files are comma-delimited and include the following fields:<br>
     time/date, in/out(type), SourceAddress,SourcePort,DestinationAddress,DestinationPort<br>
<br>
     An example:<br>
<tt>2001-09-27 01:18:13,in,195.12.147.175,27960,192.168.1.61,27960</tt><tt><br>
</tt><tt>2001-09-27 01:22:17,out,192.168.1.61,32949,slashdot.org,80</tt><tt><br>
</tt><tt>2001-09-27 01:22:18,out,192.168.1.61,32950,images2.slashdot.org,80</tt><tt><br>

</tt><tt>2001-09-27 01:29:25,out,192.168.1.61,32955,net-snmp.sourceforge.net,80</tt><tt><br>
</tt><tt>2001-09-27 01:31:22,in,211.109.111.174,80,216.15.60.120,1179</tt><tt><br>
</tt><tt>2001-09-27 01:33:20,in,61.135.139.124,63623,216.15.60.120,111</tt><br>
<br>
     Note that in the destination addresses for outgoing connections the
fully   resolved hostname will be shown if it is known. I'm assuming you
won't need   TOO much explanation of what this stuff means or else you wouldn't 
be interested   in the first place but some further information is available 
at this site,   which looks good: http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/firewall-seen.html 
     
<h4>Known Issues and Changes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I changed the name of the software from "trapmon" to "traplogger" because
 every other program in the world that does something vaguely similar seems 
to be named "trapmon." I wish I was joking. The file names remain the same 
for brevity.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Killing the snmptrapd daemon will result in the trapmond script shutting 
  down in a reasonably graceful manner. Killing the trapmond script, however, 
  will result in the snmptrapd daemon floating in the background until the 
 machine is rebooted. You will need to kill this daemon before you can start 
 the trapmond script again since only one instance of snmptrapd can run, and
 bind to port 161, at a time. When in doubt use the shell script to shut down
 the trapmond daemon.</li>
  <li>It would be nice if there were rpms or something which put the files
  in the right place and created all the symlinks and such. Maybe I'll make
  them someday.</li>
  <li>Since they are reported via SNMP traps we could log crc errors if anyone 
  is interested in those. Right now if you run from a console in debug mode
  you can see these.</li>
  <li>Should do better checking to see if the log file directory specified 
  on the cmd. line is valid.<br>
  </li>
  <li>I'd like to find out with more certainty what Linksys models this will 
  or will not work with. I am assuming it works with all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610094439/http://www.linksys.com/products/group.asp?grid=5">
     products</a>
      which are supported by Linksys' own Windows <a href="ftp://ftp.linksys.com/pub/befsr41/logviewer.exe">
     logviewer</a>
      program.</li>
</ul>
